# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Based on key features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, and embarkation point, the model determines the likelihood of survival. An intuitive **Gradio interface** allows users to interact with the model in real-time.


# ðŸ“Š Overview

- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset (`tested.csv`)
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Interface**: Gradio
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Gradio


# ðŸš€ Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Encoded categorical features
- Trained and saved model using Random Forest
- Gradio-based web interface for live predictions
- Modular code (separate training and interface notebooks)


 ðŸ§  Model Details

- Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Target Variable**: `Survived` (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
- **Input Features**:
  - `Pclass` â€“ Ticket class (1, 2, 3)
  - `Sex` â€“ Gender (male, female)
  - `Age` â€“ Passenger age
  - `SibSp` â€“ Siblings/Spouses aboard
  - `Parch` â€“ Parents/Children aboard
  - `Fare` â€“ Ticket fare
  - `Embarked` â€“ Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
